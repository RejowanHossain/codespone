          <p>
            In order to offer The Services, we need to collect information from our customers. Here is a summary of the information that we collect from our customers and what we do with it:
            <br><br>
            We collect your name, email address, and IP address. We need this information to provide you with our Services, for example, to confirm your identity and contact you.
            <br><br>
            You may voluntarily provide additional information related to the registered account such as any API key provided or images or videos you choose to upload.
            <br><br>
            We collect data about the Vonza-hosted webpages that you visit. We also collect data about how and when you access your account in order to give you access and at the same time improve our Services.
            <br><br>
            When you voluntarily share personal information with us in the course of offering your course and using our services, we store that Personal Information.
            <br><br>
            When transactions between you and our website involve payment by credit card, debit card, checks, money orders, and/or third party online payment services, we will collect information related to the transaction as part of the course of doing business with you, including billing address, telephone number, and other information related to the transaction.
            <br><br>
            When you share personal information about your customers (“learners”) we store that information for you so that you can process enrollments and better serve your customers.
            <br><br>
            This information is collected when you sign up for our Services, when you access our Services or otherwise provide us with the information. In some circumstances, when you have given us express permission, we will also use and store your personal information.

          <br><br>
          We allow you to collect the name, email, and any other personal information from your customers. Name and email are needed to allow individuals to access our Services for processes such as processing enrolments, authentication, or otherwise administering your course. This information is given on a voluntary basis when a customer uses or accesses our Services, for example when a customer visits a Vonza site, enrolls in a course, or signs up for an account on a Vonza site.
          <br><br>
          As a student progresses through your course(s) we collect information about how they interact with the course, including but not limited to, their progress through the course, quiz scores, survey results, discussion or forum contributions and other student activities.
          <br><br>
          You may collect additional information about your learners in the course of administering your course. As a course administrator, it is your responsibility to ensure that information is being collected lawfully. You should consider using a Privacy Policy or even consulting with legal counsel to understand how to ensure you are appropriately protecting the privacy of your learners.
          <br><br>
          While we technically process this information via the Vonza platform in order to administer The Services, you have the ability to access and remove this information at any point. We do not access this information unless requested by a Vonza customer.
