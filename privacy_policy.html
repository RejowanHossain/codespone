              <p>
                  In order to provide you with the best possible platform for online course creation we collect and process quite a bit of information. The purpose of this privacy policy is to help you better understand how we store, collect, and process your personal data. This policy is meant to help you understand more about why we collect and use your data whether you’re a Vonza customer or a student/subscriber to a Vonza site who uses the Vonza application or services (together known as, “The Services”), a participant in Vonza’s partner or affiliate program, or even if you’re just visiting the Vonza website. By using any of Vonza’s services or by interacting with a Vonza customer using The Services, you are agreeing to the terms of the Privacy Policy and, as applicable, the Vonza Terms of Service. In particular, by visiting this website you consent to our collection and use of your personal information as described in this privacy policy, including any updates or revisions to this privacy policy. This policy does not apply to information collected by any third party, including through any application or content that may be accessible from this website.
                  <br> <br>
                  This Privacy Policy may be updated occasionally to reflect changes to operational or legal practices, or for regulatory reasons. If and when we make changes to this policy, we will notify you of the changes by posting the revised policy on this Website or by other means when appropriate. By continuing to use this Website or the Support Service after these changes are posted, you agree to the revised terms.
                  <br> <br>
                  
                  We’ve broken this policy down into different sections so you can better understand what areas are applicable to you.

            <h2>Information we collect from our customers</h2>
            <p>
              In order to offer The Services, we need to collect information from our customers. Here is a summary of the information that we collect from our customers and what we do with it:
              <br><br>
              We collect your name, email address, and IP address. We need this information to provide you with our Services, for example, to confirm your identity and contact you.
              <br><br>
              You may voluntarily provide additional information related to the registered account such as any API key provided or images or videos you choose to upload.
              <br><br>
              We collect data about the Vonza-hosted webpages that you visit. We also collect data about how and when you access your account in order to give you access and at the same time improve our Services.
              <br><br>
              When you voluntarily share personal information with us in the course of offering your course and using our services, we store that Personal Information.
              <br><br>
              When transactions between you and our website involve payment by credit card, debit card, checks, money orders, and/or third party online payment services, we will collect information related to the transaction as part of the course of doing business with you, including billing address, telephone number, and other information related to the transaction.
              <br><br>
              When you share personal information about your customers (“learners”) we store that information for you so that you can process enrollments and better serve your customers.
              <br><br>
              This information is collected when you sign up for our Services, when you access our Services or otherwise provide us with the information. In some circumstances, when you have given us express permission, we will also use and store your personal information.

          <p>
            In order to provide you with our product and services, we store information about your students so that you can administer your course(s).
            <br><br>
            Here is some more details on what information we collect and why:
            <br><br>
            We allow you to collect the name, email, and any other personal information from your customers. Name and email are needed to allow individuals to access our Services for processes such as processing enrolments, authentication, or otherwise administering your course. This information is given on a voluntary basis when a customer uses or accesses our Services, for example when a customer visits a Vonza site, enrolls in a course, or signs up for an account on a Vonza site.
            <br><br>
            As a student progresses through your course(s) we collect information about how they interact with the course, including but not limited to, their progress through the course, quiz scores, survey results, discussion or forum contributions and other student activities.
            <br><br>
            You may collect additional information about your learners in the course of administering your course. As a course administrator, it is your responsibility to ensure that information is being collected lawfully. You should consider using a Privacy Policy or even consulting with legal counsel to understand how to ensure you are appropriately protecting the privacy of your learners.
            <br><br>
            While we technically process this information via the Vonza platform in order to administer The Services, you have the ability to access and remove this information at any point. We do not access this information unless requested by a Vonza customer.
